!Series_summary	"The aim of the study is to identify genes and pathways associated with muscle and adipose wasting in PDAC cachexia. Muscle and adipose were collected from same individuals to study the concurrent muscle and adipose wasting."
!Series_overall_design	"Muscle and adipose tissues were taken from same individuals and were subjected to Ion Ampliseq transcriptome. The two groups are non-cancer control and patients with PDAC.  RNA was isolated from muscle and adipose and was sequenced. DeSeq2 method was used to generate Differential gene expression."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
