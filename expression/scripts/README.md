# Table of Contents

## R/

Contains user-defined R scripts for functions. 

These functions are usually too bulky to be included in a notebook, so they have been extracted and placed here. Notebooks in the [notebooks](../notebooks/) folder may source these functions to be used in analysis. 

## preprocess/

Contains `STAR` and `RSEM` bash scripts used for preprocessing of raw RNA-seq data.
